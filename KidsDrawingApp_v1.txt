In this version we have done the following steps as below :

1. We have created a project in android studio with Empty Activity.
2. We have done some modification in the manifest file as per our requirement.
3. As we are about to create a drawing app so we have created a kotlin class which extends the View class 
	with some basic features as Canvas is created and on canvas using color and stroke size we are able to draw random line which are not store on canvas yet.
4. We have used the class in activities xml file to inflate it to the UI.
